### An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Problem: Louise was estimating a budget of $10,000 for a fundraiser campaign and wanted to use past data to confirm that her goal and commitment pledge was in par with past campaings. I analyzed data to see if there were any specific factors that made a campaign successful. Below are my findings:

* For one, failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn’t great news for her campaign. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it’s possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. 

### Challenge
Based on the contious analysis, Louise now has more insight into factors that will positively contribute to her campaign, based on timing and goal dollar amount.As seen below,  the number of successful campaigns is highly concentrated in the months of May and June, makign these two months the optimal launch dates. This timing is very much aligned with the rest of the NGO funraising calendar. December is a month Louise should avoid, as the holidays likely contribute to less pledges from the general public.

Limitations
We didn't have much data to analyze campaigns with goals over $15,000. If we had to analyze bigger data, having this limitation would likely skew biases in favor of the smaller goal comapigns.
